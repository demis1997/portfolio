        <p class="paragraph">
Created multiple smart contracts for tier 0  financial insittutions holding significant tvl. My responsibilities included leading the team and assigning tasks, creating a test suite using foundry or hardhat to achieve 100% coverage, securing and optimising the smart contracts. The contracts were using ERC20, ERC1400, ERC3643, IERC1155 and were upgradeable. </p>

Worked with Layerzero and Intellect, leading a team of smart contract developers, back end developers and front end developers to create a dvp which allowed for cross chain issuance and payment. We worked on both Private networks and Public networks        </p>

            I was relieved to have found assistance for the app, especially when I discovered that an editor from The Phoblographer had contacted me regarding the Reddit post. Fortunately, Diego came to my aid and swiftly mocked up some ideas for the app (pun intended). You can find The Phoblographer article

        <p class="paragraph">
Created tools that can be used by smart contract developers within the company to secure and optimize the protocols the solutions they create. The tool is also aimed to help non web3 developers create better solutions (but due to my crappy golang skills, I was not a part of in this phase) </p>
