      <h3 class="underline font-bold text-md pb-1">About Me</h3>
      <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
        I‚Äôm a senior solidity engineer who has built scalable and secure
        blockchain applications currently being used by tier 0 financial
        institutions worldwide holding significant tvl (50m +). I have a passion
        for gas optimisation and security as well as new technologies such as
        Cairo, Move and Rust.
      </p>
      <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
        I have mentored both junior solidity developers and senior back end
        engineers who have successfuly transitioned into solidity. While I
        primarily work with large web2 financial institions (because they pay
        the bills) I dabble with other defi concepts such as MEVs, AMMs, Lending
        protocols, account abstration and upgradeability daily.
      </p>
      <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
        I was a javascript and C++ developer before I transitioned into web3,
        working for a large holdings company (500m+). I found my passion for
        web3 during the NFT bullrun where I created and secured multiple nft
        contracts.
      </p>
      <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
        One of my greatest accomplishments was working with my girlfriend to
        partner with 35+ restaurants worldwide and provide discounts + free food
        to our 50k followers and our NFT holders.
      </p>
      <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
        In my spare time, I love to read sci fi books, listen to lofi and code
        with my bulldog (he writes most of the code), play video games, collect
        blu rays and mess aroung with random security tech like the flipper
        zero.
